# Chaotic Teleports

Chaotic Teleports is a mod that adds a chance of the player being randomly
teleported every tick. It has a 30 seconds cooldown, meaning, if you have 
been teleported, you can't be teleported again for 30 seconds. If 5 minutes
have gone by, the player will be teleported regardless of chance.

Every tick, the player has a 0.3% chance of being teleported, so it is almost 
guaranteed that they will be teleported before the 5 minutes have passed.

This mod works in multiplayer.
